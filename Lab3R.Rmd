IQR Temprature

```{r}
#Input dataset numeric weather into a dataframe.
weathernum <-read.table(file ="C:/Rdatasets/weathernumeric.txt", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, sep =",",
header=TRUE)
#Show the first 10 records and all the columns
weathernum[1:10,]

#Examine the 5 number summary statistics with mean for temperature and humidity. From this calculate the interquartile range

summary(weathernum$temperature)

summary(weathernum$humidity)

#For you to do! By hand, calculate the IQR for these dimensions. Are there any outliers for these variables? Use the IQR method to detect outliers = 
# Humidity Q3 - Q1 
# IQR 90 - 71 = 18.75 
# Q3 + 18.75 = 90 + (18.75) 1.5 = 43.125 outlier for humidity 
#
#Temp IQR = 78.75 - 69.25 = 9.5 
# Q3 + 9.5 = 78.75 + (9.5) 1.5 = 93 outliers for temp


#zScore Standardisation
zscore.humidity <-(weathernum$humidity mean(weathernum$humidity))/sd(weathernum$humidity)

summary(zscore.humidity)

#For you to do!??? What are the ranges for this variable for both normalisation methods? Do you think there are any outliers? min max normalization (0 < x < 1) 
#min max normalization 
#zscore (-4 < x < 4, but -3 < x <3 without outliers)
#anwer
#   No. their are no outliers here as it does not go over 3

#Write the R formula to decimal scale weathernum$humidity attribute. Hint use nchar function.Examine the summary statistics afterwards. Note any observations  

#Read in the cars2 dataset and transform weightlbs in different ways
cars2 <- read.csv(file="c:/rdatasets/cars2.txt", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

#Natural Log Transformation
natlog.weightlbs <- log(cars2$weightlbs)
natlog.weightlbs

#Square Root Transformation
sqrt.weightlbs <- sqrt(cars2$weightlbs)
sqrt.weightlbs

#Inverse Square Root Transformation
invsqrt.weightlbs <- 1/sqrt(cars2$weightlbs)
invsqrt.weightlbs

#For you to do!!
#1 Using R calculate the skewness for the car weightlbs attribute
weightSkewness <- 3* (mean(cars2$weightlbs) - median(cars2$weightlbs))/ sd(cars2$weightlbs)

weightSkewness

#2 Using R find the skewness for the natural log transformation of the car weightlbs attribute skewness = 3(mean = median) / standard deviation

weightlog <- log(weightSkewness)
weightlog

#3 Using R find the skewness for the square root transformation of the car weightlbs attribute

skewqrt <- sqrt(weightSkewness)

#4 Using R find the skewness for the inverse square root transformation of the car weightlbs attribute

skewinverssqrt <- 1/sqrt(weightSkewness)
skewinverssqrt

#5 Now re-calculate skewness using 1 or 2 (normality) transformation methods but with car weightlbs normalised using Min-Max Normalisation. Interpret your results. What do you concur?
#min / max normalization  = (x - min(x))  / (max(x) - min(x))
mmnom.weight = (cars2$weightlbs - min (cars2$weightlbs)) / (max(cars2$weightlbs) - min(cars2$weightlbs))
mmnom.weight

weightSkewness.mmnom <- 3* (mean(cars2$weightlbs) - median(cars2$weightlbs))/ sd(cars2$weightlbs)
weightSkewness.mmnom

#z-score = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
zscore.weight  = (cars2$weightlbs - (mean(cars2$weightlbs)) / sd(cars2$weightlbs))
zscore.weight
